Spring Boot Demo Admin API (reactive stack)
----
This project is a Spring Boot Admin API with the default reactive stack (WebFlux).
It automatically logs into a demo-backend(novara-demo), stores and refreshes JWT tokens, 
and includes safety measures to prevent excessive login requests. Authentication is managed through a 
dedicated filter.
